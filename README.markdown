truncate_html is a Rails helper plugin that [cuts off](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XG4DIOA7nU) a string of HTML and takes care of closing any lingering open tags. There are many possible solutions to this. This plugin does not have any dependencies, and does all it's work via [regular expressions](http://xkcd.com/208/).

The API is very similar to Rails' own <code>truncate()</code> method.


Example
-------

```ruby
some_html = '<ul><li><a href="http://whatever">This is a link</a></li></ul>'
truncate_html(some_html, :length => 15, :omission => '...(continued)')
  => <ul><li><a href="http://whatever">This...(continued)</a></li></ul>
```

A few notes:

* By default, it will truncate on word boundary.
  To truncate the HTML string strictly at the specified length, pass in the `:word_boundary => false` option.
* If the input HTML is nil, it will return an empty string.
* The omission text's length does count toward the resulting string's length.
* `<script>` tags will pass right through - they will not count toward the resulting string's length, or be truncated.
* To truncate the html at a specific point not based on length but content, place the `:break_token` in your source. This allows the truncation to be data driven, breaking after a leading paragraph or sentence.
* If the `:break_token` is in your content before the specified :length, :length will be ignored and the content truncated at :break_token
* If the `:break_token` is in your content after the specified :length, `:break_token` will be ignored and the content truncated at :length
* The default options are:
  * :length => 100
  * :omission => '...'
  * :word_boundary => true
  * :break_token => '<!-- truncate -->'

You may also set global configuration options.
For example, place the following on a sensible place,
like `config/initializers/truncate_html.rb`

```ruby
TruncateHtml.configure do |config|
  config.length        = 50
  config.omission      = '...(continued)'
  config.word_boundary = false
  config.break_token   = '<!-- break -->'
end
```

If you really want, you can even set a custom word boundary regexp.
For example, to truncate at the end of the nearest sentence:

```ruby
TruncateHtml.configure do |config|
  config.length        = 50
  config.omission      = ''
  config.word_boundary = /\S[\.\?\!]/
end
```
